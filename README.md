# Objective

The objective of the project was to create a map visualisation of the census done by Health In Harmony. You can access the final product <a href = "https://felipemonroy.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/"> here </a>

# About the census

The survey is a census of 1321 households in about 30 villages surrounding Manombo protected area along the South East Coast of Madagascar and comprised 65 questions. Many of the questions are identical to national survey questions done by the government (and the agency we hired conducts the government surveys as well) so in some cases, such as infant mortality, it will be good to compare to national data which is freely available on-line.

# Inspiration

The map visualisation was inspired by the work of Sean Angiolillo "Electricity, Latrine & Water Access in India" ([link here](https://github.com/seanangio/in_household/))
